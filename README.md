## User Story

My motivation is to stand out to the client and market the website for their Media. In thi this project I learned how to code with semantics and accessibility standards. I was also motivated to find any misplaced positioning or fix an error. I built this project to assist the marketing agency fix any errors to their website and make it more user friendly and accessible to everyone. I learned to work together as a team and were able to resolve issues that weren't very obvious but visible.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
